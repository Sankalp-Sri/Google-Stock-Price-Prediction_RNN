# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction_RNN
In this particular use case I've  used the Recurrent Neural Network LSTM to predict the Stock Price of Google.

Using a Keras Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model to Predict Stock Prices. LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because they're able to store past information. This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.
